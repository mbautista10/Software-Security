# Software-Security

Our Client Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investment, and insurance for their patrons, wanted to implement and apply the most current and adequate software security. 

I believe I grasped the concept of running a dependency check and also implementing it. It is essential to know the vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them. To any company, it will give a sense of security. However, it was challenging to find all the current updates. But after finding all the vulnerabilities and refactoring code, which gave me an increased layer of security, I found no vulnerabilities in the dependency report. 

I believe cipher algorithms will become handy in my future assignments. For example, I have a cybersecurity class next term, and Iâ€™m positive ciphers will be mentioned or used. Finally, to demonstrate my skills, knowledge, and experience, I would showcase my use of ciphers and the dependency tests. Both are skills that will enhance the security of any software.
